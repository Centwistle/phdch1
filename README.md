"# phdch1" 
This is the GitHub Repo for the first chapter of my economics PhD.

It contains several files:
- USOC_individuals.csv is the public version of the dataset the analysis is based on. The full dataset for the regressions is obtained via Special Licence and as such is not publicly shareable.
- individual_wave_merger.csv is the R file that merges the individual data files together into a chained annual datafile.
- Ch1EDAMarkdown.Rmd is the exploratory and descriptive data analysis file based on the public dataset, it is accompanied by:
- Ch1EDAMarkdown.html which is the output of the markdown dataset.
- Merger_Special_Licence.R is the merger file for the private special licence dataset used for the regressions.
- Analysis_File.R contains the code to generate the specific variables for the regressions (treatments, categorical variables etc.) and all output files.
- Tables and Figures is a folder which contains all the outputted summary statistics, regression tables and supporting material related to matching and diagnostic testing (parallel trends etc.)

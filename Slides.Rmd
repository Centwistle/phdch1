## What Am I Looking At?

### The Summary

> -   Specifically at childcare costs and how they broadly impact the labour market.
> -   First chapter aims to look at specific policy reforms and how individual and household labour supply change in response.
> -   I use a 2017 policy change in England that expands free entitlement of childcare for working parents from 15 hours per week to 30 hours per week.
> -   Deploy a difference-in-difference empirical strategy to assess various labour supply responses (intensive and extensive).
> -   Exploit age of eligibility variation arising from the policy design.
> -   Mixed with matching methods to create control group from similar parents who miss out due to eligibility cutoffs.
> -   Tentative (very tentative) early results suggest no impact.

## Specific Policy

> - I look specifically at the 2017 expansion of childcare entitlement from 15 hours per week to 30 hours per week.
> - Policy intended to help parents of 3-4-year olds. 
> - Access to policy is dependent on income (equivalent to 16 hours per week worked at national minimum wage)
> - Age of eligibility set by cohorts (see below).
> - ![](C:/Users/40344509/Documents/Ch1%20Rep/Differentiation/images/eligtable.png)
> - These cutoffs for access create variation to be exploited.

## Wider Literature Inconsisent on Impact on Labour Supply {.smaller}

### First Forays

> -   Early theoretical grounding provided by Heckman (1974)
>     -   Adapts canonical neoclassical model of labour supply for impact of either lump sump subsidy or per-hour worked subsidy.
>     -   Differential impacts for different categories of mother (i.e. those already working and those not)
>     -   Generally will increase labour supply but ultimately depends on preferences (MRS).
>     -   Also calibrates structural econometric model to estimate responses to various subsidy levels.

### Subsequent Findings

> -   Raft of structurally estimated econometric models during the 1980s and 1990s.
> -   Wide range of labour supply elasticities produced in US.
>     - On extensive margin, ranges from -0.2 (Connolly, 1992) to -0.92 (Anderson and Levine, 1999).
>     - On intensive margin, ranges from -0.024 (Ribar, 1995) to -0.78 (Averett, Peters and Waldman, 1997)

## Wider Literature Inconsisent on Impact on Labour Supply {.smaller}
### Later Findings

> - After Credibility Revolution during mid-90s - present, emphasis shifts to causal inference methods.
> - Typically framed around specific policy interventions and quasi-experimental design:
>     - Havnes & Mogestad (2011) analyse long-run impacts from policy interventions in Norway. Find no net increase in maternal labour supply.
>     - Nollenberger & Rodriguez-Planas (2015) look into early '90s reforms in Spain. Find +2.1% extensive margin impact, signif at 10% level.
>     - Germany: Bauernschuster & Schlotter (2015) find free kindergarten raised participation by 6 per cent. 
>     - Germany: Gathmann & Sass (2018) find *introduction* of costs to generate no labour supply response from mothers.
>     - UK: Brewer et al. (2021) estimate movement from part-time to full-time childcare (using minimum schooling age) increases participation by 2.1%.
> - Inconsistency in labour supply findings mirrored by inconsistency in second-order impacts (crowding out, deadweight loss etc.)

## Data Used
### Description
> - I utilise the special licence version of *Understanding Society* (USOC). This is an individual and household longtiduinal survey in the UK covering the years 2009 - 2022. 
> - This dataset includes a comprehensive and unparalleled range of variables relating to personal characteristics, economic and labour market data, as well as childcare specific information.
> - The advantages of using USOC as a datasource is the fact that it removes the need to link or merge with other data sources and potentially lose accuracy of the data.

## Data Used 
### Data Overview

```{r}
usocfilt %>% filter(jbhrs >= 0) %>% select(sex_dv, intdaty_dv, age_dv, birthy, relationship, ltsick, educat, inedorwork, ftemp, ptemp, jbhrs, usecccare) %>% st(out = 'kable') %>% kable_minimal("hover", full_width = T, position = "float_right")
```


> - Above shows the summary statistics for the overall data set used after initial sampling decisions taken.
> - Contains key personal characteristics as well as economic outcomes and childcare-related variables.

## Empirical Strategy
### Treatment 

> - I identify those treated as those eligible for the free childcare based on the criteria set out by HMG.
> - Unfortunately USOC does not contain any specific variables that identify whether individual uses free childcare policy so identification rests on identifying those eligible and impact on aggregate (limitation of design).
>     - i.e. testing the impact of the policy rather than testing specifically on those who use policy.
> - Replication code for treatment generation in "Analysis_File.R"
> - Identifies treated individuals based on interaction between:
>     - Child date of birth (requires month of birth).
>     - Date of observation being recorded.
>     - Eligibility cohort.
>     - Parental household income.
> - Code a dummy variable for those treated vs. those not.

## Empirical Strategy
### Baseline Regressions

> - As an initial diagnostic, I check the degree to which those identified differ from the wider population.
> - I run logit and probit regressions to understand the degree of difference.
> - Results largely as would be expected.
> - Those treated exhibit:
>     - Strong age effects (probability of treatment increases with age before sharply dropping)
>     - Strong likelihood of being in a relationship.
>     - Less likely to have long-term illness.
>     - Somewhat more likely to be educated (A-level and above).
>     - Less likely to be in full-time education or work.
>     - Log income does not seem to have any impact at all.

## Empirical Strategy - Logit Results

</center>

## Empirical Strategy - Probit Results

<center>
![](C:/Users/40344509/Documents/Ch1 Rep/Differentiation/images/baselineprobit.png)

## Empirical Strategy - Matching

> - Given that there exist substantial differences (possibility for self-selection into treatment) then necessary to balance treated with adequate control group.
> - I opt for matching methods to generate a sub-sample as close to the treated as possible.
> - Use R's *'MatchIt'* package to run through several matching methods. 
> - Settle on Nearest Neighbour with resampling (i.e. allowing more than one observation to be assigned as a control).
> - Match on a variety of personal characteristics - leaving economic variables to vary between groups.
> - Results for matching are good - with minimal distance between treated and controls.

## Empirical Strategy - Matching Summary Stats

```{r}
usocmatch %>% filter(jbstat > 0) %>% select(treated, sex_dv, intdaty_dv, age_dv, birthy, relationship, ltsick, educat, inedorwork, ftemp, ptemp, jbhrs, usecccare) %>% st(out = 'kable') %>% kable_minimal("hover", full_width = T, position = "float_right")
```

## Empirical Strategy - DiD Specification

> - Following in the steps of commonly used methods in the literature I opt for a difference-in-difference strategy to estimate the labour supply response.
> - Policy impact, i.e. average treatment effect, is determined by the interaction of the treatment variable with the treatment period.
> - I code the treatment period as a dummy observation for any observation date ocurring after 1st September 2017 - the date the policy was enacted.
> - Regression specification takes the form:
> - <center> ![](C:/Users/40344509/Documents/Ch1 Rep/Differentiation/images/did.png) </center>
> - With the 𝛿 capturing the policy response.
> - The dependent variable *Y* in this case is either the extensive margin (employment), intensive margin (hours worked) or a measure indicator the ratio of full-time workers out of all those employed.

## Results 
### Initial Findings

```{r, fig.align='center'}
kable(didcomp, escape = F) %>% kable_minimal("hover", full_width = T, position = "center")
```

## Results
### Discussion

> - In all 3 cases there does not appear to have been any response to the 2017 expansion.
> - Coefficient values in all cases are low.
> - No statistically significant effect whatsoever.
> - While early stages - this is comfortingly not a complete outlier in comparison to other estimates.
> - Nevertheless, does pose questions why there are differences between these findings and those of Brewer et al. (2021) who also look at UK-context *and* at change between PT and FT care but do find a response.
> - What could be responsible? What would next steps be?

## Conclusion and Next Steps
### Critical Reflection on Results
> - These are evidently a very tentative first-pass of results. 
> - Difference between these results and Brewer et al. (2021) could be driven by personal characteristics of those treated.
>     - In their case looking at parents of children entering primary school.
>     - In this case looking at parents of 3-year olds. 
>     - Descriptive data does suggest a secular trend towards more working as children age, but probably not enough to explain *all* of the difference here.

### Practical Next Steps
> - Lots of room for QA and robustness checks.
>      - Limited time to conduct sweeps for errors. Some obvious ones already identified (use 2010 rather than 2009 as beginning date).
> - Robustness checks (placebo effects, pre-trends etc.)
> - Expanding variables of interest to second-order effects.
>     - Crowding out, distributional impacts etc.

## Conclusion and Next Steps (cont.)
### Methodological Concerns

> - Large literature over the past 2 years relating to DiD.
> - Heterogenous timing effects.
> - Heterogenous treatment groups.
> - Still considering most appropriate estimator from that literature to incorporate.

### Still...

> - More than likely that I've omitted some concerns or not thought of things.
> - Very open to suggestions!

## ...And finally...
### Plans for 2nd chapter

> - Already ramping up plans for primary data collection.
> - Intending to webscrape childcare.co.uk for pricing data.
> - Would present a wealth of options for further analysis.
>      - e.g. impact of staff-to-child ratios relaxing in September 2023.
>      - e.g. impact of further expansion in 2024.
> - Unknown number of profiles on website - but estimated sample size per 24 hour webcrawl would result in ~17,000 observations.

>     -   Generally will increase labour supply but ultimately depends on preferences (MRS).
>     -   Also calibrates structural econometric model to estimate responses to various subsidy levels.

### Subsequent Findings

> -   Raft of structurally estimated econometric models during the 1980s and 1990s.
> -   Wide range of labour supply elasticities produced in US.
>     - On extensive margin, ranges from -0.2 (Connolly, 1992) to -0.92 (Anderson and Levine, 1999).
>     - On intensive margin, ranges from -0.024 (Ribar, 1995) to -0.78 (Averett, Peters and Waldman, 1997)

## Wider Literature Inconsisent on Impact on Labour Supply {.smaller}
### Later Findings

> - After Credibility Revolution during mid-90s - present, emphasis shifts to causal inference methods.
> - Typically framed around specific policy interventions and quasi-experimental design:
>     - Havnes & Mogestad (2011) analyse long-run impacts from policy interventions in Norway. Find no net increase in maternal labour supply.
>     - Nollenberger & Rodriguez-Planas (2015) look into early '90s reforms in Spain. Find +2.1% extensive margin impact, signif at 10% level.
>     - Germany: Bauernschuster & Schlotter (2015) find free kindergarten raised participation by 6 per cent. 
>     - Germany: Gathmann & Sass (2018) find *introduction* of costs to generate no labour supply response from mothers.
>     - UK: Brewer et al. (2021) estimate movement from part-time to full-time childcare (using minimum schooling age) increases participation by 2.1%.
> - Inconsistency in labour supply findings mirrored by inconsistency in second-order impacts (crowding out, deadweight loss etc.)

## Data Used
### Description
> - I utilise the special licence version of *Understanding Society* (USOC). This is an individual and household longtiduinal survey in the UK covering the years 2009 - 2022. 
> - This dataset includes a comprehensive and unparalleled range of variables relating to personal characteristics, economic and labour market data, as well as childcare specific information.
> - The advantages of using USOC as a datasource is the fact that it removes the need to link or merge with other data sources and potentially lose accuracy of the data.

## Data Used 
### Data Overview

```{r}
usocfilt %>% filter(jbhrs >= 0) %>% select(sex_dv, intdaty_dv, age_dv, birthy, relationship, ltsick, educat, inedorwork, ftemp, ptemp, jbhrs, usecccare) %>% st(out = 'kable') %>% kable_minimal("hover", full_width = T, position = "float_right")
```


> - Above shows the summary statistics for the overall data set used after initial sampling decisions taken.
> - Contains key personal characteristics as well as economic outcomes and childcare-related variables.

## Empirical Strategy
### Treatment 

> - I identify those treated as those eligible for the free childcare based on the criteria set out by HMG.
> - Unfortunately USOC does not contain any specific variables that identify whether individual uses free childcare policy so identification rests on identifying those eligible and impact on aggregate (limitation of design).
>     - i.e. testing the impact of the policy rather than testing specifically on those who use policy.
> - Replication code for treatment generation in "Analysis_File.R"
> - Identifies treated individuals based on interaction between:
>     - Child date of birth (requires month of birth).
>     - Date of observation being recorded.
>     - Eligibility cohort.
>     - Parental household income.
> - Code a dummy variable for those treated vs. those not.

## Empirical Strategy
### Baseline Regressions

> - As an initial diagnostic, I check the degree to which those identified differ from the wider population.
> - I run logit and probit regressions to understand the degree of difference.
> - Results largely as would be expected.
> - Those treated exhibit:
>     - Strong age effects (probability of treatment increases with age before sharply dropping)
>     - Strong likelihood of being in a relationship.
>     - Less likely to have long-term illness.
>     - Somewhat more likely to be educated (A-level and above).
>     - Less likely to be in full-time education or work.
>     - Log income does not seem to have any impact at all.

## Empirical Strategy - Matching

> - Given that there exist substantial differences (possibility for self-selection into treatment) then necessary to balance treated with adequate control group.
> - I opt for matching methods to generate a sub-sample as close to the treated as possible.
> - Use R's *'MatchIt'* package to run through several matching methods. 
> - Settle on Nearest Neighbour with resampling (i.e. allowing more than one observation to be assigned as a control).
> - Match on a variety of personal characteristics - leaving economic variables to vary between groups.
> - Results for matching are good - with minimal distance between treated and controls.

## Empirical Strategy - Matching Summary Stats

```{r}
usocmatch %>% filter(jbstat > 0) %>% select(treated, sex_dv, intdaty_dv, age_dv, birthy, relationship, ltsick, educat, inedorwork, ftemp, ptemp, jbhrs, usecccare) %>% st(out = 'kable') %>% kable_minimal("hover", full_width = T, position = "float_right")
```

## Empirical Strategy - DiD Specification

> - Following in the steps of commonly used methods in the literature I opt for a difference-in-difference strategy to estimate the labour supply response.
> - Policy impact, i.e. average treatment effect, is determined by the interaction of the treatment variable with the treatment period.
> - I code the treatment period as a dummy observation for any observation date ocurring after 1st September 2017 - the date the policy was enacted.
> - Regression specification takes the form:
> - <center> ![](C:/Users/40344509/Documents/Ch1 Rep/Differentiation/images/did.png) </center>
> - With the 𝛿 capturing the policy response.
> - The dependent variable *Y* in this case is either the extensive margin (employment), intensive margin (hours worked) or a measure indicator the ratio of full-time workers out of all those employed.

## Results 
### Initial Findings

```{r, fig.align='center'}
kable(didcomp, escape = F) %>% kable_minimal("hover", full_width = T, position = "center")
```

## Results
### Discussion

> - In all 3 cases there does not appear to have been any response to the 2017 expansion.
> - Coefficient values in all cases are low.
> - No statistically significant effect whatsoever.
> - While early stages - this is comfortingly not a complete outlier in comparison to other estimates.
> - Nevertheless, does pose questions why there are differences between these findings and those of Brewer et al. (2021) who also look at UK-context *and* at change between PT and FT care but do find a response.
> - What could be responsible? What would next steps be?

## Conclusion and Next Steps
### Critical Reflection on Results
> - These are evidently a very tentative first-pass of results. 
> - Difference between these results and Brewer et al. (2021) could be driven by personal characteristics of those treated.
>     - In their case looking at parents of children entering primary school.
>     - In this case looking at parents of 3-year olds. 
>     - Descriptive data does suggest a secular trend towards more working as children age, but probably not enough to explain *all* of the difference here.

### Practical Next Steps
> - Lots of room for QA and robustness checks.
>      - Limited time to conduct sweeps for errors. Some obvious ones already identified (use 2010 rather than 2009 as beginning date).
> - Robustness checks (placebo effects, pre-trends etc.)
> - Expanding variables of interest to second-order effects.
>     - Crowding out, distributional impacts etc.

## Conclusion and Next Steps (cont.)
### Methodological Concerns

> - Large literature over the past 2 years relating to DiD.
> - Heterogenous treatment effects.
> - Heterogenous treatment groups.
> - Still considering most appropriate estimator from that literature to incorporate.

### Still...

> - More than likely that I've omitted some concerns or not thought of things.
> - Very open to suggestions!

## ...And finally...
### Plans for 2nd chapter

> - Already ramping up plans for primary data collection.
> - Intending to webscrape childcare.co.uk for pricing data.
> - Would present a wealth of options for further analysis.
>      - e.g. impact of staff-to-child ratios relaxing in September 2023.
>      - e.g. impact of further expansion in 2024.
> - Unknown number of profiles on website - but estimated sample size per 24 hour webcrawl would result in ~17,000 observations.
